# Ajaxify Rails  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ncri/ajaxify_rails.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ncri/ajaxify_rails)

No more full page reloads for your Rails app! Yay! 

Automatically makes your app loading content in the background via Ajax.

Works by turning all internal links into Ajax links that trigger an update of the page's content area. 
Also form submissions are automatically turned into Ajax requests.

Features: 

- Uses the html5 history interface for changing the url and making the browser's back and forward buttons work with Ajax.
- Falls back to a hash based URL approach for browsers without the history interface (like Internet Explorer version <10).
- Hash based and non-hash URLs are interchangeable.
- Transparently handles redirects and supports page titles and flash messages.
- Tested with Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Internet Explorer 8+.

Demo: http://ajaxify-demo.herokuapp.com/ (the first page load might take a while, as heroku needs to spin up a dyno)

Blog Post: http://rubyandrails.posterous.com/introducing-the-ajaxify-rails-gem

Inspired by the pjax_rails gem (https://github.com/rails/pjax_rails).

## Requirements

- Ruby 1.9 and the asset pipeline,
- jQuery,
- Your app doesn't use named anchors (#). Named anchors can't be correctly represented in the fallback hash based url scheme.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ajaxify_rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

In your application.js file add:

    //= require ajaxify_rails

## Usage

Call `Ajaxify.init()` in your layout's javascript.
Do this as early as possible to ensure Ajaxify's interchangeable url schemes (history api vs. hash based urls)
work most effectively. 

The later you call `init()`, the later potential redirects from one scheme to another are performed,
which means the more unnecessary work the browser has to do.

### Content Area

Ajaxify assumes that your app has a content container html tag with the id `main`.
This tag is the container wrapping the yield statement in your layout.
If yield doesn't have a wrapper in your app yet, you need to supply one to get ajaxification working:

    #main
      = yield

You can set the content container of your app when initializing Ajaxify:

    Ajaxify.init 
      content_container: 'content_container_id'

or later using `set_content_container`:

    Ajaxify.set_content_container('content_container_id')
    
    
### Loader Animation

You probably like to have a loader image to be displayed to the user while content loads via Ajax.
This is simple. Ajaxify automatically inserts a loader div with the class `ajaxify_loader` into
the content wrapper before starting an Ajax request. So just supply styles for `.ajaxify_loader` in your css, with an
animated gif as a background.

### Scrolling

By default, ajaxify scrolls to the top of the screen when you click on a link.
You can change this default behavior by setting 'scroll_on_click' to false on init.

    Ajaxify.init
      scroll_on_click: false

You can also change the setting for individual links by adding classes:
    = link_to "Scroll to top", scroll_to_top_path, class: 'scroll_to_top'
    = link_to "Don't scroll", no_scroll_path, class: 'no_scroll'

### Page Title

If you define a method called `page_title` in your application controller, returning the current page's title, Ajaxify will
use it to automatically update the title tag after the main content has changed.

### Navigation and other Layout Updates

It's a common use case to have a navigation that needs to change its appearence and possibly functioning when the user navigates
to a different section of the page. Ajaxify provides a success callback that is triggered after successful
updates of the page's main content. Just bind to the `ajaxify:content_loaded' event and make your layout changes:

    $('body').on 'ajaxify:content_loaded', ->
      # update navigation and/or other layout elements


### Flash Messages

Ajaxify correctly displays your flash messages after ajaxified requests.
By default, only `flash[:notice]` is supported. If you are using for example `flash[:warning]` as well you have to add the flash_types
option to the `Ajaxify.init()` call:

    Ajaxify.init 
      flash_types: ['notice', 'warning']
    
Also make sure that you supply invisible wrapper tags in your layout for each flash type you use, with the id set to the type, e.g.:

    #notice{ style: "#{'display:none' unless flash[:notice]}" }
      = flash[:notice] 
    
### Full Page Reloads

Sometimes requests change the layout of the page so significantly that loading only the main content via Ajax
and doing some minor layout tweaks here and there are simply not sufficient.

There might also be links and forms which already have their own Ajax functionality.

For these cases you can turn off Ajaxify, by simply adding the class `no_ajaxify` directly to links or forms:

    = link_to 'Change everything!', re_render_it_all_path, class: 'no_ajaxify'


### Root Redirects

Sometimes you need to redirect on the root url. 

For example you might have a localized application with the locale inside the url.
When a user navigates to `your_domain.com` he/she gets redirected to e.g. `your_domain.com/en/`. This works fine in browsers supporting
the html 5 history api. However, for browsers without the history api like Internet Explorer before version 10, Ajaxify needs hints
about your url structure to not get confused (it creates endless redirects otherwise!). You need to explicitly supply all possible root
paths.

Example: if your app's root url potentially redirects to `your_domain.com/en/` and `your_domain.com/de/`
you need to hint Ajaxify like this:

    Ajaxify.init
      base_paths = ['de', 'en']

Important: `Ajaxify.base_paths` need to be set before `Ajaxify.init()` is called!


### Extra Content

Sometimes you need to do non trivial modifications of the layout whenever the content in the main content area of your site changes.
Ajaxify allows you to attach arbitrary html to ajaxified requests. This extra html is then stripped from the main content
that is inserted into the content area. But before that a callback is triggered which can be used to grab the extra content and do something with it.
To use this feature you need to provide a method `ajaxify_extra_content` in your ApplicationController:

    def ajaxify_extra_content
      ... your extra html ...
    end

For example you could provide html for a widget in the layout like this:

    def ajaxify_extra_content
      "<div id='my_fancy_widget_html'> some html </div>"
    end

And then, on the client side bind to the `ajaxify:content_inserted` event and select the widget html via `#ajaxify_content`:

    $('body').on 'ajaxify:content_inserted', ->
      $('#my_fancy_widget').html $('#ajaxify_content #my_fancy_widget_html').html()

Tip: you can call view helpers to render extra content from within your controller using the view_context:

    def ajaxify_extra_content
      view_context.my_fancy_widget
    end

### Ajaxify Events

Ajaxify provides a few jQuery events you can bind to:

* `ajaxify:before_load` => Triggered before the ajaxify request is started. Params: `url`.
* `ajaxify:content_loaded` => Triggered after an ajaxify request finished successfully. Params: `data, status, jqXHR, url`.
* `ajaxify:content_inserted` => Triggered after an ajaxify request finished but before extra content is stripped from the response.
* `ajaxify:flash_displayed` => Triggered after a flash message is displayed. Parameters: `flash_type`.


### Javascript

In addition to calling your javascript e.g. in a dom ready event handler (or in your layout), you should also
call it in an `ajaxify:content_loaded` event handler, to make sure it is executed after content has
loaded via Ajaxify.


### Toggle Ajaxify

You can temporarily deactivate Ajaxify by calling `Ajaxify.activate(false)`. You can switch it on again with `Ajaxify.activate()`.
